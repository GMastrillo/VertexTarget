The trajectory details the onboarding of a new AI engineer to the VertexTarget project, focusing on a critical authentication bug. The process began with the AI engineer reading  to understand the project history. Initially, the engineer hypothesized a JWT secret mismatch between  and . After applying this fix and re-running , further testing revealed the *actual* root cause: a hardcoded database name () in  conflicting with the correct database name () used during user seeding. The AI engineer successfully corrected both the JWT variable and the database name usage, re-seeded the admin user, restarted the backend, and confirmed the login functionality was fully restored, allowing the project to proceed.

<product_requirements>
The project is VertexTarget, an interactive web portfolio for a technology agency, built with React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) and using MongoDB Atlas for the database. The application is hosted, with the frontend on Vercel and backend on Render, and database connection is functional. Most of the site is complete and connected. The previous AI engineer was implementing and testing the Administrative Area (CMS).

The critical problem identified is a 401 (Unauthorized) error during administrator login using . This error persists even after the  script has been run to create the admin user. The consequence is an inability to test any CMS functionalities (create, edit, delete portfolio/testimonials). The immediate goal was to diagnose and fix this login issue. Subsequent tasks include concluding backend CRUD tests for Portfolio and Testimonials, and finalizing the  frontend implementation. The login bug has been successfully resolved, with the system now ready for further administrative area testing.

<code_architecture>
The project has a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and utility scripts.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**

**Backend Files ():**

**Frontend Files ():**


- ****: This is the core FastAPI application. It handles API endpoints, including authentication (). It uses  for token generation/verification and interacts with MongoDB. It contains the  and  functions.
    - **Changes made**:
        - Line 104: Modified the  call to correctly retrieve  (previously looking for ).
        - Modified the database connection logic to use the  environment variable instead of a hardcoded database name, resolving the core login issue.

- ****: This file stores environment variables crucial for the backend, such as  and .
    - **Changes made**: The variable  was confirmed to be correctly named and used.

- ****: This utility script is responsible for seeding initial data into the MongoDB database, specifically creating the  user. It uses the  function consistent with .
    - **Changes made**: The script was re-executed to ensure the admin user was created in the correct database after the  fix in .

- ****: This file serves as a communication log and detailed record of the user's problem statement, previous tests, and current testing protocols. It's critical for context and understanding prior actions.
    - **Changes made**: Updated by the testing agent to reflect the successful resolution of the login bug.

<pending_tasks>
- Conclude the backend tests for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities related to Portfolio and Testimonials.
- Finalize the implementation of  in the frontend to complete the visual interface of the administrative area.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully diagnosed and resolved a critical 401 authentication error for the administrator login in the VertexTarget application. The primary issue was traced back to two key inconsistencies:
1.  **JWT Secret Variable**: The  was attempting to retrieve  from environment variables, while the  file defined it as . This was corrected in  to ensure the correct JWT secret was used.
2.  **Database Name Inconsistency**: The more critical root cause was that  was hardcoding the database name as  for user lookup, while the  script was creating the admin user in a database named  (derived from an environment variable ). This mismatch prevented the login process from finding the correctly seeded admin user. This was corrected by modifying  to use the  environment variable for database access, ensuring consistency.

After applying these corrections, the  was re-executed to ensure the admin user was correctly created or updated in the . The backend server was then restarted. Comprehensive backend testing was performed using , which confirmed that the admin login () now functions correctly, generates a valid JWT token, and properly handles both valid and invalid credentials. The authentication system is now 100% operational, and the administrative area is accessible.
