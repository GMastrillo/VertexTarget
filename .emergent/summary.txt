The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a cutting-edge portfolio website for VERTEX TARGET. The project adheres to a strict design brief, emphasizing brand identity, specific color palettes, and interactive elements. The chosen approach prioritizes a frontend-first development strategy, utilizing mock data to create a compelling user experience before integrating the backend. This initial phase focuses on scaffolding the core UI components to provide an aha moment early in the development cycle. Key components like the Hero, Services, and Portfolio sections have been drafted, along with a dedicated mock data file. The current state is that the initial frontend components have been created and the engineer is proceeding with the remaining UI sections, still leveraging mock data.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to design and develop a premium portfolio website for VERTEX TARGET, a technology agency specializing in website/application creation, AI automations, and precision digital marketing. The design must reflect ambition, precision, and technological sophistication.

Key requirements:
*   **Color Palette**: Strictly based on the logo – deep black background (#000000), vibrant purple and blue/indigo as primary interactive/title/graphic colors, white for main text.
*   **Typography**: Strong, geometric, similar to Montserrat or Exo 2.
*   **Homepage Sections**:
    *   **Hero Section No Cume**: Impactful animation (mountain outline, pulsing target), slogan (Atingindo o Pico do seu Potencial Digital.), CTA (Nossas Estratégias) with purple-blue gradient.
    *   **Nossos Serviços (Arsenal de Precisão)**: Icon-based section (Marketing, Development, AI) with neon hover effects, revealing brief descriptions and expanding for details.
    *   **Portfólio (Expedições de Sucesso)**: Clean grid gallery, pico conquistado metaphor, purple translucent hover with project name/metric, linking to detailed case study pages (jornada até o cume).
    *   **Nossa Metodologia (A Escalada)**: Vertical timeline animating a mountain ascent (Basecamp, Acampamento 1 & 2, Cume) with target icons.
    *   **Demonstração de IA (Calibre seu Alvo)**: Interactive section where users select industry/objective, receiving AI strategy suggestions or data visualizations.
    *   **Depoimentos e Parceiros**: Elegant testimonials on a subtle mountain-textured background, monochrome partner logos.
    *   **Contato (Fale com um Estrategista)**: Simple form, Pronto para alcançar seu próximo pico?, submission button micro-interaction (target being hit).
*   **Global Design Elements**: Geometric shapes (square from logo), subtle background animations (radar/topographic grid), total responsiveness (simplified hero animation for mobile), mandatory micro-animations, layered depth (shadows, blurs, gradients), bold typography, asymmetrical layouts, ample whitespace, detailed quality (grain textures, custom cursors), interactive storytelling, performance optimization, unexpected delight.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router DOM for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, Radix UI for components, Axios for API calls.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for API, MongoDB (via Motor) for database.
- **Deployment/Environment**: Docker, Supervisor for process management,  files for environment variables.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack project within the  directory, comprising a React frontend and a FastAPI backend with a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: This is the main React application file. Initially, it contained a basic Hello World setup with an Axios call to the backend. It has been modified to integrate the newly created , , and  components using  for routing. It's the central hub for frontend routing and component composition.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains basic CSS rules. Its purpose is largely superseded by Tailwind CSS but might contain specific global styles not managed by Tailwind.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**: This file imports Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities. It also defines custom CSS variables for light and dark themes using , which are consumed by Tailwind's  color definitions, ensuring consistent theming.
-   **/app/frontend/tailwind.config.js**: The configuration file for Tailwind CSS. It extends the default Tailwind theme with custom colors defined in , border-radius values, and animations like  and , ensuring the application adheres to the brand's visual identity and animation guidelines.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Manages frontend dependencies, including React, React Router DOM, Axios, various Radix UI components, , , , , and development dependencies like , , , and .
-   **/app/frontend/src/hooks/use-toast.js**: A custom React hook for managing and displaying toast notifications, providing functionality to add, update, dismiss, and remove toasts.
-   **/app/frontend/src/mockData.js**: *Newly created*. This file serves as a central repository for all mock data required by the frontend components. This ensures a clear separation of concerns and facilitates easier transition to real backend data later.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/HeroSection.jsx**: *Newly created*. This component is responsible for rendering the No Cume hero section, including the animated mountain/target, slogan, and CTA button. It uses data from .
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Services.jsx**: *Newly created*. This component renders the Nossos Serviços section, displaying service categories with icons, hover effects, and expandable descriptions using data from .
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Portfolio.jsx**: *Newly created*. This component displays the Portfólio gallery in a grid layout, showcasing projects with hover effects and leading to detailed case studies (currently mocked) using data from .
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: The main FastAPI application file. It sets up the API router with a  prefix, handles MongoDB connection using , defines Pydantic models for data validation, and includes basic routes like  and . It also configures CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend, including , , , , , , and various development/utility packages.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the remaining frontend sections: Nossa Metodologia (The Ascent), Demonstração de IA (Calibrate Your Target), Depoimentos e Parceiros (Testimonials and Partners), and Contato (Speak with a Strategist).
-   Implement dynamic animations and micro-interactions for all interactive elements as specified in the design guidelines.
-   Transition from mock data to actual backend integration.
-   Develop MongoDB models and CRUD endpoints for all dynamic content.
-   Backend and Frontend testing using the specified testing agents.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully scaffolded the initial frontend of the VERTEX TARGET portfolio website. This includes the creation of  to provide placeholder content, and the implementation of key visual components such as the , , and . These components have been integrated into the main  file, establishing the basic routing structure for the application. The goal was to deliver an initial, functional frontend experience with mock data to demonstrate the visual direction and core features. The engineer is currently in the process of building out the remaining frontend components, still operating under the frontend with mock data first strategy, before proceeding to backend integration and full functionality.
